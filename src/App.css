/*
  Any styles specific to the App component's immediate layout can go here.
  However, most global styles are now in src/index.css.
  Component-specific styles are in their respective CSS Modules.
  This file can be kept minimal or empty if App.tsx doesn't need unique global styling.
*/

/* Example: If App component itself had a specific layout structure not part of MainLayout */
/* .app-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
} */
